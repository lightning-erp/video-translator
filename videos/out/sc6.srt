00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 How to create a customised system for your M3?

0
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 We have been working on the M3 system for a long time.

0
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 We created our configuration, our database,

0
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 our information about suppliers, customers, items.

0
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 We ordered the item, we received it on the stand

0
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 and we managed it within our warehouses.

0
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Now we will move a little further.

0
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 We will skip production and move on to sales.

0
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 The module that we see between the M3 and the M3,

0
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 which we see between production and sales,

0
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 is a warehouse module that will not be practically different

0
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 from managing reserves and ready-made products

0
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 from what we have already discussed before.

0
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 But what about the sales module?

0
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 In the sales module we want our product,

0
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 which we have in the warehouse,

0
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 and it doesn't necessarily have to be a product

0
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 that is ready to be sold to the customer.

0
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 When we have our reserves

0
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 and even if we want to sell our stock of cardboard,

0
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 or raw material, or any other stock we have,

0
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 we can do it.

0
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Let's go to the company structure

0
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 and we can distinguish two basic things.

0
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Two basic transactions that can take place during sales.

0
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 It can be group sales,

0
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 i.e. between our divisions within our entire group,

0
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 or external, out-of-group,

0
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 i.e. from each division to an external customer.

0
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 The process of sending, preparing goods and sales

0
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 does not differ when it comes to the performance of the system,

0
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 but the settings differ,

0
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 because with our customers we will have different settings

0
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 than when we accept the settings of group sales.

0
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 When selling goods,

0
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 we will rely on the already defined settings

0
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 in the environment in which we work

0
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 during the discussion of activities in M3.

0
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I will show you in a moment

0
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 how to sell goods to another division.

0
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 As I said, the only thing that we can do

0
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 is to sell goods to another division.

0
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 As I said, the only thing that will differ

0
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 between sales,

0
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 between divisions and external customers,

0
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 will be the choice of the appropriate contractor

0
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 when creating a transaction,

0
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 and the already saved configurations in the system

0
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 will properly control our activities.

0
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 The procedure of sending and selling

0
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 our stock to the client

0
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 and regardless of whether it will be a group or external customer,

0
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I encourage you to start by examining our stock,

0
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 what we will actually want to sell.

0
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Let's go to the MWS060 application

0
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 and find the goods we have received.

0
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Let's assume that we want to sell

0
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 this stock that we see here

0
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 about this specified flight,

0
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 i.e. PZTEST02.

0
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 We have copied the number of our product,

0
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 copy the flight number right away,

0
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 it will be very useful for us.

0
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Now let's go back to our products for a moment.

0
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Let's go back to our structures for a moment.

0
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 What do we need to send this product further?

0
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 If we already know what product we want to send,

0
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 what product do we have to prepare?

0
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 In fact, we need to enter the order of sale.

0
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 We have already entered the purchase order

0
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 and now we have to create a new one.

0
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 We have to create a new purchase order from our store.

0
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Let's assume that LISAKI DEUTSCHLAND

0
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 will want to buy a stock from LISAKI POLSKA.

0
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Now LISAKI DEUTSCHLAND has sent their purchase order to us

0
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 and we have to enter this purchase order

0
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 as a sales order.

0
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Only when we do this and enter the order line,

0
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 the order line of this sales order,

0
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 will we be able to allocate our goods,

0
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 our stock,

0
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 our stock of the purchase order

0
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 and send them.

0
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 To do this, we return to M3

0
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 and prepare the OIS300 application.

0
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 The OIS300 application contains a collection of sales orders.

0
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 These are customer orders

0
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 that are introduced into our system

0
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 and on the basis of which we will perform

0
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 the movements leading to the delivery of the shipment

0
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 and the sale of our stock.

0
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Of course, depending on how we want to sort the list of these orders,

0
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 we choose the type of sorting we are interested in

0
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 and the type of view with which

0
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 before starting work in the sales module,

0
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 it is worth getting acquainted.

0
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Everyone will simply find the right view for themselves.

0
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 We will go to our division.

0
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 We now have a list of all sales orders

0
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 for our division.

0
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And to enter the sales order

0
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 on the basis of the purchase order

0
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 that we received from our customer,

0
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 we go to New Order

0
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 and in turn we complete all the data

0
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 that we need to conduct the transaction.

0
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 We start to complete the data

0
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 required to conduct the transaction.

0
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 We complete the customer's number.

0
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 When the goods will reach the customer,

0
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 we assume that it will be on June 30th

0
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 and the customer's address.

0
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 We can now enter the number of the customer

0
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 and the number of his purchase order.

0
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Let's assume that it will be this number.

0
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 When we have entered the data we need,

0
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 things like the type of customer order

0
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 and the rest will be automatically displayed,

0
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 because during the creation of the order,

0
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 we must have already entered the customer's card.

0
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 The customer's data will be completed,

0
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 which was also possible during configuration

0
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 in the CRS 620 application.

0
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 All this information was added to it.

0
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 We click Control 1,

0
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 then F12

0
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 and Enter.

0
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 To proceed further.

0
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 The card opened.

0
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 The first order header card,

0
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 in which we complete the exact data

0
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 regarding the currency,

0
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 regarding the price and conditions,

0
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 the payment details.

0
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 If everything is correct,

0
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 what we expect to appear on this card,

0
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 we click Next, Enter.

0
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 We go to the order details.

0
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 In this case, we discuss here in turn

0
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 what is responsible for what,

0
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 what parameter we can here,

0
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 enter and what it will mean

0
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 for the whole creation of the transaction.

0
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 The data that is already here,

0
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 introduced, which we see here,

0
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 are the basis of what we have completed

0
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 during the previous configurations.

0
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 If only our configuration assumed that

0
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 we can, during the creation of the order,

0
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 sales,

0
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 edit this information,

0
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 we can do it here.

0
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 At the beginning, we make sure

0
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 whether we have indicated a good

0
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 warehouse from which we will,

0
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 from which we will issue our product,

0
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 what are our references.

0
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 In this place, I usually complete

0
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 the name and surname of the person

0
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 working on this warehouse,

0
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 so that she knows that it is addressed to him.

0
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 It is also worth entering here

0
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 the person or department

0
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 that appears on the purchase order

0
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 that we received from the client.

0
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Based on this contact and the order number

0
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 of the purchase order

0
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 that we received from our client,

0
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 it will be possible to immediately identify

0
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 and facilitate the accounting

0
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 of the entire transaction later.

0
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 We can add a person who will be

0
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 and who is responsible for the sale

0
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 to this particular client,

0
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 unless there is a person

0
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 who is concerned properly

0
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 about the payment list,

0
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 felt more comfortable

0
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 in

0
00:13:49,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 responsibilities.

0
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 We will see other possibilities that can be configured in relation to payment methods depending on the transaction.

0
00:12:43,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Next, we will specify the amount of days to be paid, the terms of the invoice, VAT, taxes and, going further, the key dates.

0
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 The dates that we see here are the first and last date of the possibility of accepting this order.

0
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 The second is the date of the payment of the payment by our client.

0
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 If there is such a possibility and the client gives us the possibility of delivery, let's say, between Monday and Friday of the next week, we can supplement this range here.

0
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Or we can specify a specific day depending on the amount of orders with the client.

0
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 As we have set in this case, it will be only and exclusively 30.06.

0
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 A fairly important parameter is also the possibility of marking this checkbox, abnormal demand.

0
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 This parameter, if it is marked, will be information for the system.

0
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 If, of course, we use automation, calculations and planning of stock, sales, shipments and maintenance of our stock,

0
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 we can mark that this is an order.

0
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 We can also mark the number of orders that are not to be counted in all these calculations.

0
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Perhaps it will happen that it will be an additional request or it will be a small fraction of the client's needs to meet his needs.

0
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 We will not want it to have any impact on the customer's business.

0
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 We will also check the number of orders that are to be counted in the system.

0
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 We select the method of transport, whether it will be road, air, train or ship.

0
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 We also select the delivery terms, i.e. how the goods and everything will be picked up.

0
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Delivery at place is a parameter indicated by us on this countermeasure.

0
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 However, we know what the delivery status is.

0
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 If the delivery status is not selected by our customer, we will add the EXW parameter.

0
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 If we have already selected our delivery method, we can specify where it is.

0
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 The location was indicated to us in connection with our previous configuration.

0
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 The address was also transferred from the first configuration card that we have just defined by entering the basic order data.

0
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 There is also a Delivery Specification option.

0
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 If we have additional ramps, storage places that we have configured in the system set within the address,

0
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 we can directly specify that this is the delivery address.

0
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 This goods should be unloaded at B square in ramp C40.

0
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 In addition, we can add a manual comment where it should be unloaded.

0
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 The goods that I send in this way most often go to ramp N1, so I will allow myself to enter this parameter.

0
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 The next settings are drawn from the original configuration and are appropriate for the transaction.

0
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I press Enter and proceed.

0
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 At this point, the OS101 application opens.

0
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 This is an application that allows you to create a order link inside the order.

0
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 We will add the order line to our stock and provide the details of this line.

0
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 At this point, we will use our texts written in the note, i.e. our flight number, our article number.

0
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 We do not have to fill in the magazine here, because the magazine was indicated earlier.

0
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 What we can do right away if we go to this stage of creating a sales order,

0
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 we can immediately copy our order number to the note.

0
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 It will be very important.

0
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Because thanks to this, we will find our order number in an easy way in the next steps.

0
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 We copy it.

0
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It is safe now.

0
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 We forget.

0
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And we complete the parameters of our line.

0
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 We paste the number of our article.

0
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 We check what the amount was.

0
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 We can also copy.

0
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 We paste.

0
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 We can enter units for sure.

0
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 We copied from our stock where there were basic units, i.e. pieces.

0
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 So here we will also copy the pieces.

0
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Sales price.

0
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And we enter if we do not use sales price indicators.

0
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 At this point I do not have such a configuration, so I will enter sales price.

0
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 But I will enter it as one.

0
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I'll explain why in a moment.

0
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 We can also enter further for what unit it is the price.

0
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Let's enter also for a piece.

0
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And we can give, we must give the date of the order to the line.

0
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 As I mentioned, to each line in this configuration,

0
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 we can enter another delivery date.

0
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Also, if we had selected the delivery range in the previous cards of creating this order,

0
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 we can then enter the date of the first delivery and the date of the last delivery.

0
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 It will be a visible range, a visible time space in which we will carry out individual deliveries of our lines.

0
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 If we have it prepared, we press enter.

0
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 We go to the details of this order line.

0
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And the following information is compiled into these details.

0
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 First, we set the details of our delivery for this particular line.

0
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 The general address will be the same as for the entire order,

0
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 but we can, for example, if we have configured ramps or storage places in a given location,

0
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 we can indicate other parameters for each order line.

0
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So 5 pallets will go to A square, 5 pallets to B square, the rest to C square, to such and such ramp.

0
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Here we also confirm the delivery method, what type of transport it will be,

0
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 the dates of these deliveries.

0
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And we have to indicate the route.

0
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Why is it so important and what is the route parameter?

0
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Since it is an Ex Works delivery, i.e. EXW,

0
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 we will choose the parameter corresponding to this option for our configuration, i.e. P10EXW.

0
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Now, what is this route?

0
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Let's open the answer.

0
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 What is the route?

0
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 The route, this parameter, this configuration of this parameter,

0
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 allows us to write down the actual traffic

0
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 that is

0
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 assigned to the road.

0
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And we can also write down the route of the transport.

0
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 So, when we choose the route P10EXW,

0
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 we know how this product will be loaded,

0
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 how it will be unloaded

0
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 and how it will be implemented.

0
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 So P10EXW will be an Ex Works delivery,

0
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 but if it is a parameter that will not be a delivery type of Ex Works,

0
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 i.e. that our client takes it,

0
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 only from above it will be known which way this product will be driven,

0
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 i.e. let's assume P10Augsburg,

0
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 we know that then our product will be taken,

0
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 by the carrier,

0
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 will go a certain way,

0
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 through a certain city

0
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 and will reach the destination

0
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 through these locations indicated in this configuration,

0
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 in one way or another.

0
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 So it can be a connected transport,

0
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 direct load,

0
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 another route,

0
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 or as we chose here,

0
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Ex Works,

0
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 i.e. it will be taken by the client

0
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 and we are not interested in how this product will be moved further.

0
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 In this configuration, if everything is correct on this card,

0
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 we click Enter

0
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and we see that our line

0
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 of order

0
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 has already been created.

0
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Now we have given that the price for a piece of cardboard

0
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 will be 1 euro.

0
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 This is how we chose during creating this order line.

0
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 We chose this way because by giving our sales price here,

0
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 we cannot detail it completely,

0
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 we cannot give the price,

0
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 for what amount is this price,

0
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 we can only give the total price and unit,

0
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 so I simplify it in this place as much as I can.

0
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Always regardless of the currency,

0
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 there will be parameter 1 here

0
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 and the indicated unit of the price.

0
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And only now,

0
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 by marking the line,

0
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I enter through CTRL 2

0
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 by changing to the middle of this line

0
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 and at this point I complete the details,

0
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 i.e. the price,

0
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I confirm the amount

0
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 and refer to the price

0
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 and in this place

0
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 I have the possibility

0
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 to give the price in detail

0
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 for our piece.

0
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Because we have previously given the euro currency

0
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 and the price unit in the piece,

0
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 it will be 1 euro per piece.

0
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 And now we can indicate

0
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 how much the piece will cost.

0
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And we can also specify

0
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 how much the price will be for each piece.

0
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 So for 1 euro

0
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 we can buy, for example,

0
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 1000 pieces.

0
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 If we set it like this,

0
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 we press ENTER,

0
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 we have been warned by the system

0
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 that in our configuration

0
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 we can set the maximum

0
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 price for the amount

0
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 to the amount of 999,

0
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 because we have configured

0
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 our item

0
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 that it can have

0
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 a maximum of 4

0
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 digits after 0

0
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 in the price configuration.

0
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 To change this,

0
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 we would have to go back

0
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 to the first MMS,

0
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 which we configured

0
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 at the very beginning.

0
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Since we cannot

0
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 choose such a counter,

0
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 let's try to make

0
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 a counter in this system.

0
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 0.1

0
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 for 1 piece.

0
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And at this point

0
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 we have

0
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 the price

0
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 of the piece

0
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 that we have

0
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 for each piece.

0
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And now

0
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 the system has allowed us

0
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 to make such a change.

0
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Of course,

0
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 we must know earlier

0
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 in what price frames

0
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 we want to move

0
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 to configure such

0
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 parameters

0
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 that will allow us

0
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 to manage prices

0
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 in such a way

0
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 that we can fit

0
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 in the frames

0
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 that we set

0
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 for each item.

0
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I will finally change the price

0
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 to 0.001

0
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 for 1 piece.

0
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 We go further.

0
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 We can add

0
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 details

0
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 about the

0
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 item itself,

0
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 i.e. modify

0
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 its description,

0
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 its name,

0
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 give

0
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 alias number,

0
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 which was previously

0
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 assigned,

0
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 give the part number,

0
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 the number of another item

0
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 that can function

0
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 interchangeably for this item.

0
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Once again,

0
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 we can configure,

0
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 give accurate data

0
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 from the purchase order

0
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 that we received

0
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 from our client.

0
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 And not only do we have

0
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 the possibility

0
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 to enter the order number,

0
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 but also to specify,

0
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 for example,

0
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 which is the line

0
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 from this order,

0
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 what is the value

0
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 to which this line relates,

0
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 which we are creating now.

0
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Of course,

0
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 we can also

0
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 enter the number

0
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 of our contract,

0
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 if it exists,

0
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 our sales price,

0
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 if we use it.

0
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 If not, we go further.

0
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 We can also

0
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 enter the person

0
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 responsible for the sale,

0
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 also enter the reason

0
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 of the sale,

0
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 if it exists

0
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 and we want to configure it,

0
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 or we have configured it

0
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 earlier and we want to indicate it.

0
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Of course,

0
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 we can also enter the date again,

0
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 the range,

0
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 if this order can be moving

0
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 and can come in a given

0
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 time period, for example, in a given week,

0
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 we can enter the date

0
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 and then we complete it

0
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 if there is such a need,

0
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 the country of origin

0
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 of this item,

0
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 which we enter

0
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 in our order line

0
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 and other business

0
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 settings.

0
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 If everything is correct,

0
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 we press enter,

0
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 go to the details,

0
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 calculations

0
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 regarding the line,

0
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 we can configure it again here,

0
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 we can enter the

0
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 VAT code

0
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 or the location,

0
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 the lot number

0
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 that we want to enter

0
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 during the allocation of this item,

0
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 if we want to

0
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 add, for example,

0
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 the use of a given reserve

0
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 to the warehouse.

0
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Of course, we also confirm

0
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 the amount of the payment

0
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 if everything is correct.

0
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 We go further.

0
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Here we have

0
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 an indication

0
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 to our

0
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 transport line.

0
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 We have already

0
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 passed all this

0
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 before.

0
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 We confirm

0
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 and our

0
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 line has been

0
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 properly configured

0
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 when it comes to

0
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 delivery details

0
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 and price details.

0
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 We see that

0
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 the price of the entire order

0
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 has changed significantly

0
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 and in the next steps

0
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 we will go to the allocation

0
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 to connect our reserve

0
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 under this line,

0
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 under this request,

0
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 under this order

0
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 so that we can

0
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 move on to the further

0
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 part of the

0
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 transaction of

0
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 sales and shipping of goods.

0
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Thank you.
